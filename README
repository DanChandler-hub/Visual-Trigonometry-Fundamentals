README file - Visual Trigonometry Fundamentals program

This free program was designed to be a tool that can be used by students, instructors, and tutors to reveal the relationships between the unit circle and the three major trig functions (sine, cosine, tangent).

Students learning trig sometimes find it hard initially to see how a circle with radius one relates to functions that look like ocean waves (sine and cosine) and the mysterious repeating function, tangent.

The VTF program allows the student to enter an angle value (or a range of angles) and then view the angle in all four graphical forms (sine wave, cosine wave, tangent, and the unit circle) simultaneously. 

The program is written in Python, using tkinter.  The version of Python used during development was 3.13.7

Testing was done on a Windows machine, using a screen resolution of 1920 by 1080.  
The program was tested using other screen resolutions as well (1280 by 800 and 1366 by 768) and should be usable on various handheld devices and laptops as well as desktop computers.  The program cannot be used on a cell phone.
Further testing will be done on Linux and Mac computers when resources allow.

If you make any useful changes, let me know so I can consider incorporating them into my version.
If you discover any bugs, let me know.

See accompanying file VTF_Screenshot.jpg to see an example of the program's visual display.
